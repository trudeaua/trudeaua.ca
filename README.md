## Description
This project was built as a .NET Core 3.0 Web Application using Angular 8 for the front end. It **will** use MySQL as a back end for storing messages, and Firebase Hosting for hosting.
The goal of this project is to help colleagues and potential employers know more about myself and my skill set.
